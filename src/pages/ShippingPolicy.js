                            <p>We have to shell out a major chunk of money on shipping because we pay the actual shipping costs for most items on our site. Shipping prices are set individually for each item and can be found next to the price on the item’s description page. Another way of saying is we don’t make our money on shipping charges: we guarantee the lowest delivered price on every item we sell.</p>

                            <p>We only ship on business days. Saturdays, Sundays, and Public holidays are not business days.</p>

                            <p>However, Special requests can be made for arranging the delivery on a specified date and we shall try our best to deliver it as per your details.</p>

                            <p>We cannot change a shipping address on an order after it has shipped. If an order is returned because it couldn’t be received at the listed shipping address, we will accept the return but will not refund the shipping charges.</p>

                            <p>Our most popular items ship the same business day your order is placed when you place a valid order before the shipping deadline. Immediate shipment is available Monday through Friday. A valid order placed before 2pm IST will ship the same day. Orders placed after 2pm IST will ship the next business day.</p>

                            <h4>Which items ship immediately?</h4>

                            <p>Items that ship immediately show on the website as “ships today” or “ships next day” depending on whether you are looking on a weekday or a weekend, and depending on whether you are looking before or after the cutoff time on a business day.</p>

                            <p>This display is based on availability information that updates from our warehouse to our website almost in real-time. We are highly confident of the status of each item whenever you view a page. However, we do not reserve inventory being viewed or even placed in shopping carts. So please be aware that we cannot guarantee this information until you have checked out. In particular, if you have been in the checkout area for more than about 10 minutes, we do recommend that you refresh the page to get the most current inventory prior to checking out.</p>

                            <h4>Does immediate shipment mean immediate delivery?</h4>

                            <p>Once an order is shipped, our carriers typically guarantee a service time for when the order will be delivered to you. Our carriers have a very good record of delivering at their promised service time. We will ship immediately, and on all items we will refund expedited shipping charges if the carrier’s service levels for your chosen shipping method are not met.</p>

                            <h4>What can I do if you don’t feel we’ve lived up to our guarantees?</h4>

                            <p>If you ever feel we have not lived up to any of our guarantees, we want to know about it – and we want a chance to do right if we agree. Contact Us.</p>

                            <h4>Delivery Expectation</h4>
                            <p>Majority of the buyers receive their order(s) within 12-15 business days. Free Products with free shipping are normally delivered to customers within 15 days. Products with shipping charges are delivered to customers in 7 days. Musical instruments and PA equipment are delicate and sensitive things that must be carefully examined and stored. While we cannot ship at lightning rates, our techniques provide a near-zero transit-damage rate in India, which we would like to maintain. Our main objective is to get your products to you securely.</p>
